# Task 4: Password Security & Authentication Analysis
## 🛡️ Cyber Security Internship Submission

### 📋 Project Overview
This project focuses on the analysis of password storage mechanisms, the identification of cryptographic hashes, and the practical application of password recovery tools. Through hands-on labs, I demonstrated how to audit authentication security by identifying and cracking various hash types.

### 🛠️ Tools & Environments Used
* **Learning Platform:** TryHackMe
* **Primary Tools:** Hashcat, John the Ripper (JTR)
* **Alternative Tools:** Online Hash Identifiers
* **Wordlist:** `rockyou.txt`

### 🧪 Practical Lab: TryHackMe "Crack the Hash"
I successfully completed the **Crack the Hash** challenge, which required identifying and cracking hashes of increasing complexity.

#### **Cracking Methodology**
1. **Identification:** Used length and character patterns to identify MD5 (32-bit), SHA-1 (40-bit), and bcrypt ($2y$) hashes.
2. **Dictionary Attack:** Leveraged `rockyou.txt` to find common passwords.
3. **Salting Analysis:** Cracked SHA-512 salted hashes, demonstrating how added random data (salts) protects passwords.

#### **Key Successes:**
* **Level 1:** Recovered passwords "easy", "password123", and "letmein".
* **Level 2:** Successfully cracked salted hashes like "waka99" and numeric strings.

### 🔍 Security Recommendations
* **Avoid Weak Algorithms:** Deprecate MD5 and SHA-1 as they are vulnerable to rapid cracking.
* **Implement Salting:** Always use unique salts to prevent the use of precomputed Rainbow Tables.
* **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):** Enforce MFA to provide a secondary layer of defense even if a password is compromised.
* **Slow Hashing:** Use algorithms like **bcrypt** or **Argon2** which are computationally expensive to brute force.
