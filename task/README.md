## 📊 Detection Report Analysis
- **61 / 70 security vendors** flagged the file as malicious
- File type identified as **Win32 DLL (PE32 executable)**
- Classified as **Trojan / Ransomware / Stealer**
- High-risk malware based on multiple antivirus detections

---

## ⚙️ Observed Behavior Indicators
- Drops multiple files after execution
- Uses **process injection** and **shared modules**
- Establishes **persistence** using boot/logon autostart mechanisms
- Performs **defense evasion** (sandbox detection, obfuscation, long sleeps)
- Communicates with external **domains and IP addresses**
- Encrypts data indicating **ransomware behavior**

---

## 🔄 Malware Lifecycle
1. **Delivery** – Distributed through ZIP or bundled files  
2. **Execution** – DLL loaded into system processes  
3. **Persistence** – Ensures execution after reboot  
4. **Defense Evasion** – Avoids detection and analysis  
5. **Command & Control** – Communicates with remote servers  
6. **Payload Execution** – Data encryption and file dropping  
7. **Impact** – Data loss and system compromise
