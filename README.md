# Elevate-CS-Task_1-
# Cyber Security Internship - Task 1

## Overview
This repository contains my research on Cyber Security Basics and Attack Surfaces. The goal was to understand the CIA Triad, identify threat actors, and map out how data moves through a system.

## Deliverables
1. **Task_1_Report.pdf**: A detailed document explaining security foundations.
2. **Screenshots**: Visual proof of research conducted on OWASP and Google Security blogs.

## Key Learnings
* Mastering the CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability).
* Identifying attacker motivations (Script Kiddies vs. Nation-State Actors).
* Mapping attack surfaces like APIs and Cloud environments.
* Tracing data flows to find security vulnerabilities.
